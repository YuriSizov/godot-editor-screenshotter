# Editor Screenshotter concept

Take quick snaps of the Godot Editor's UI by using a round button at the top right corner or by pressing <kbd>F11</kbd>. You can use <kbd>Alt + F11</kbd> to take partial screenshots with a preview of an area to be snapped.

It is not popup friendly at the moment. It can take their images, but cannot highlight their parts.
